"""Server routes for the note_detect plugin.

POST /api/plugins/note_detect/recording
    Body: raw bytes of a RIFF/WAVE file (mono PCM is what the browser
    encodes; we don't crack it open, just validate the header).
    Query: ?slug=<safe-filename-slug>   (optional, defaults to "recording").
    Returns JSON: { path_in_container, relative_path, filename, bytes }.

POST /api/plugins/note_detect/live-judgment
    Body: JSON object — one judgment record produced by the detector.
    Query: ?session=<id>   (sanitised; defaults to "default").
    Returns JSON: { ok: true, appended: <bytes> }.
    Appends one JSON line to
    ``static/note_detect_recordings/live_<session>.jsonl``. The plugin
    streams judgments here only when tuning mode is on (or while
    armed-for-training; see /training-bundle below), so steady-state
    play has zero overhead. Each line is a self-contained record —
    safe to tail / read partially / replay.

POST /api/plugins/note_detect/training-bundle
    Body: JSON { slug, wav_filename, session, manifest, arrangement, upload_url }.
        slug    — used to name the bundle, and to locate the WAV when
                  ``wav_filename`` is absent (newest matching
                  ``note_detect_<slug>_*.wav``).
        wav_filename — exact WAV filename from the /recording response;
                  preferred over the slug glob so concurrent same-slug
                  takes can't be paired with the wrong WAV. Optional.
        session — locates the live-judgment JSONL written by
                  /live-judgment (``live_<session>.jsonl``). Optional —
                  bundle proceeds without it if absent or empty.
        manifest — JSON object recorded as-is into ``manifest.json``
                   inside the bundle. The server adds schema, created_at,
                   and resolved filename/bytes fields before writing.
        arrangement — optional ground-truth note chart, written as
                   ``arrangement.json`` inside the bundle.
        upload_url — optional pCloud destination override.
    Bundles the located files + manifest into
    ``training_<slug>_<ts>.zip`` under the recordings directory, then
    POSTs the bundle (multipart/form-data) to the curated pCloud public
    upload link (``_PCLOUD_UPLOAD_CODE`` below). On upload failure the
    local zip is retained so the user can retry manually. Returns JSON
    with ``ok`` and either ``pcloud_result`` (success) or ``error``.

All three endpoints write under ``<base>/note_detect_recordings/``, where
``<base>`` is the first writable directory among ``$STATIC_DIR``,
``$CONFIG_DIR``, and ``/app/static``. In Docker, ``$STATIC_DIR`` (or the
``/app/static`` bind mount) is host-reachable, so recordings land there.
In the packaged desktop bundle ``$STATIC_DIR`` is unset and the bundled
static tree is read-only, so recordings fall back to ``$CONFIG_DIR`` —
the user's writable data directory. The base is resolved lazily on the
first write (and cached) so route registration never fails; a host with
no writable candidate at all turns into a clean 500 on save.
